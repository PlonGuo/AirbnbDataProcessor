We are near everything Albany has to offer.  Washington Park, an 81-acre estate that was designed in the late 1800s, is on the adjacent street.  The New York State Capitol, The MVP Stadium, Albany Medical Center, art museums, and restaurants are a brisk walk away, and it takes about a 5-minute drive to the SUNY Albany campus.",

You'll have breakfast, lunch, dinner, shopping, groceries, and much more in a short walk from the front door.  We are close to many historic architectural buildings, hiking trails and fishing spots in and around the Albany area.",
